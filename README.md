# hello-world
Hi everyone! You can call me Westley, or West, whichever is easiest for you. I live in the great state of Texas and I'm really excited to get started with this class! I'm an artist and really enjoy creating with different mediums. I also have a pretty good sized family, with one older brother, a younger brother, and 4 younger sisters. I'm interested in seeing what I can create with programming this semester! Last semester I took CIT160 and wow, it was quite the challenge. I also took COMM130, which was super fun for me, and because of that I think this is the course I want to take in my schooling.
